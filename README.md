# audio_visualizer
A simple program which draws an audio waveform on the screen.
It uses the computers microphone to get an audio buffer. The background images, colors and text-content can be changed through Terminal (console) when running the app executable file.
It uses OpenGL for graphics (with a simple GUI library called [opengl_gui](https://github.com/linusced/opengl_gui/)) and OpenAL for the microphone audio input.

# Download
In the future I might add a way for users to download the .app file/directory (for mac only).
